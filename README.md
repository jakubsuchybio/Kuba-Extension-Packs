These are extension packs of Visual Studio Extensions, that I personally use and with this I'd like to share them with you.
I will write summary for each and how it helps me.

# Must-have Extension Pack:

[**File Icons:**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.FileIcons)
- Shows multiple file icons inside Solution Explorer for each file extension types.
- This is really convenient when working in solution that has resources,
content files, libraries, config files to better differenciate between them.

[**Match Margin:**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioPlatformTeam.MatchMargin)
- Shows additional information in scroll-bar. Like other occurences of selected text, etc.
- This is a must-have for me. It greatly improves navigation inside one file,
when I want to find other occurences of some word without using 'Find'.

[**Microsoft Child Process Debugging Power Tool:**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsdbgplat.MicrosoftChildProcessDebuggingPowerTool)
- It automagically attaches debugger to any new child processes that are created from already debugging application.
- This is espeacially usefull when debugging something at the startup of child process,
because there is often small time window to attach. With this it is no effort.

[**Shrink Empty Lines:**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioPlatformTeam.SyntacticLineCompression)
- Reduces height of empty lines in code, resulting in more code visible to you.
- For me, it is really convenient to see much more code than without this extension.

[**SwitchStartupProject for VS 2019 (Preview):**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vs-publisher-141975.SwitchStartupProjectForVS2019)
- Adds combobox in top toolbar for switching between startup projects. Definitions are in config file with repository and it supports multiple startup projects as well.
- For developing CP3 it is really convenient for switching between 3 startup projects (server+agent+client) and other projects

[**SwitchStartupProject for VS 2017:**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vs-publisher-141975.SwitchStartupProjectforVS2017)
- Ditto

[**Trailing Whitespace Visualizer:**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.TrailingWhitespaceVisualizer)
- Renders unnecessary spaces in code with red background.
- This is a must-have. It greatly reduces noise when doing code reviews, because there are a lot less diff lines.

[**VSColorOutput:**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MikeWard-AnnArbor.VSColorOutput)
- Adds color to build output window.
- It is awesome for quickly identifying if build fails (red lines),
so it gives faster feedback about the build even before it finishes.
